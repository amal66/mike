-- Migration date: 2026-08-21

-- Mirror the org-membership visibility branch into
-- get_tabular_review_ids_overview.
--
-- 20260727_01 introduced this RPC as a lightweight companion to
-- get_tabular_reviews_overview for the bulk "select all matching"
-- action behind GET /tabular-review/ids: it returns only id + owning
-- user for the entire filtered set, duplicating the visibility
-- predicate rather than delegating (SQL has no clean way to share a CTE
-- across two function definitions). Its header carried an explicit
-- warning: if the access rules in get_tabular_reviews_overview's
-- visible_reviews CTE ever change, mirror the change here too.
--
-- The organizations work (20260821_03 and, for the paginated overload,
-- 20260821_04) changed exactly those rules — a third visibility branch,
-- "rows tagged with an org the caller belongs to", alongside "row
-- owner" and "shared_with email" — but this RPC was never updated, in
-- the migration or in schema.sql. The symptom is subtle: an org member
-- SEES a colleague's org-shared reviews in the list (paginated
-- overview), but "select all matching" quietly omits them, because the
-- ids RPC computes a smaller visible set. Bulk actions then operate on
-- fewer rows than the user believes they selected.
--
-- This migration adds the same two org-membership arms the paginated
-- overview uses, keeping the two predicates in lockstep:
--   * accessible_projects: projects whose org_id is in an org the
--     caller belongs to (EXISTS against org_members) — in-project
--     reviews of org colleagues;
--   * the row filter: org-tagged reviews owned by someone else, visible
--     in the global list (p_project_id is null).
--
-- The function body below is byte-identical to schema.sql's, so fresh
-- installs (bootstrapped from schema.sql) and migrated installs end up
-- with the same definition. As elsewhere: org membership grants
-- visibility, not ownership, and — per 20260813_01's convention — RPC
-- parameters stay text while the bodies cast uuid columns at the
-- database boundary.
--
-- Signature is unchanged, so create-or-replace only; safe to re-run.
