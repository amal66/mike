/**
 * DMS secret handling reuses the EXACT AES-256-GCM scheme the MCP connectors
 * use (lib/mcp/client.ts). We deliberately do not reinvent crypto: the same
 * master secret, the same key derivation, and the same fail-closed decrypt
 * path back every encrypted DMS auth config and OAuth token column.
 *
 * The master secret resolves in this order (see mcp/client.ts::encryptionSecret):
 *   MCP_CONNECTORS_ENCRYPTION_SECRET → USER_API_KEYS_ENCRYPTION_SECRET
 * DMS_CONNECTORS_ENCRYPTION_SECRET is accepted as an alias by copying it onto
 * MCP_CONNECTORS_ENCRYPTION_SECRET at startup (see src/index.ts) so operators
 * can name the variable after the feature without a second crypto
 * implementation.
