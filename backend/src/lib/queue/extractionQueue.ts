 * from the database at run time (review columns, current cell state, the row's
 * source documents, the owner's model + API keys), so the job payload stays tiny
 * and — importantly — carries NO secrets into Redis. This also makes the job
 * idempotent and retry-safe: on a retry it re-reads cell state and only
 * processes columns that are not already `done`.
